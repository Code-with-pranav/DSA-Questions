# DSA-Questions
This repository contains a set of basic data structure and algorithm (DSA) questions with solutions. The questions cover fundamental programming concepts, such as array manipulations, pattern printing, palindrome checking, and sorting. These exercises are ideal for beginners who want to practice DSA concepts in C/C++. 

# DSA Questions Set 1, Set 2, and Set 3

This repository contains three sets of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) practice questions along with their solutions. These exercises cover a variety of programming and algorithmic challenges ideal for beginners and intermediate programmers aiming to improve their problem-solving skills in C/C++.

## Contents

### Set 1
- Array manipulations (e.g., counting negative numbers, finding maximums)
- Basic pattern printing (e.g., triangles, parallelograms)
- Palindrome checks in arrays
- Frequency counting and unique elements in arrays

### Set 2
- Subarray sums and inversion counts
- Equilibrium index finding in arrays
- Two-pointer technique for array pair sums
- Stock price and sliding window techniques for subarrays

### Set 3
- Advanced array and string operations
- Square-free number calculations
- Spiral matrix traversal
- Cyclic palindrome transformations and happy number checks

## Usage

To view or run the code:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Code-with-pranav/DSA-Questions.git`
2. Open each questionâ€™s solution file and execute in a C/C++ compiler.
